4-Technical challenges faced: 
Challenge 1:
Automating the SEToolkit menu, which can usually be solved by “expect” (but it is complicated for us)
Our solution:
Use echo command with newline; as it is simpler to use
Challenge 2:
Scripts need same IP across machines.
Our solution:
Defined the IP addreses and then called them with ”$”; avoids any unnecessary errors and is more reliable
